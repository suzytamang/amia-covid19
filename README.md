# AMIA LaTeX paper template

A basic AMIA (American Medical Informatics Association) style compliant LaTeX paper skeleton.

**Problem:** AMIA conference doesn't provide a LaTeX template for submissions. It only provides a Microsoft Word template. And we know the possible and unexpected problems of collaborating with Word.

**Solution:** Use pandoc to generate a skeleton from the Word template. Then, adapt the LaTeX file skeleton to make it look *as similar as possible* to the normal PDF output of Word.

## Compile

The file `amia-paper.tex` can be compiled using pdflatex or latex. However, these two compiler do not compile an output as the one required because they don't use Time News Roman font. LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX compilers can be used instead. ([Texmaker] provides all the previous options.)

To compile the project using LuaLaTeX:
```bash
$ lualatex amia-paper.tex
$ bibtex amia-paper
$ lualatex amia-paper.tex
$ lualatex amia-paper.tex
```

## Bibliography

According to the recommended bibliography styles, I could find that `vancouver` is one of the most populars, and widely used in previous AMIA publications. If you have other suggestion, let me know.
